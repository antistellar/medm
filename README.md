# Mass Effect Deathmatch

## Info

This is a simple text-based game about cockfighting the playable characters of mass effect. Yep. I made this program back when I was teaching myself how to program so I'm aware that the documentation and implementation are garbage.  I'm leaving it as is so I can laugh at myself in the future. As such, this program has attained the 'Works on my Machine' badge of honor. I make no promises about it working anywhere else.
